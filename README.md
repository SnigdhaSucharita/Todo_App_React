# Todo-App
##Description

Welcome aboard fellow developer. This is a Todo App build with the help of MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React, Node). It requires users to signup and signin and then allows users to add, mark done and delete tasks. With this app users can effortlessly manage their tasks , helping them stay organized and on top of their to-do list. I hope you enjoy and I look forward to your contributions!
